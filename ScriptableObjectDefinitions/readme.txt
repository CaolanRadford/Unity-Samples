Scriptable Objects are a super useful data type that sticks around inbetween Unity instances.
In 'Ratbag', I use one to define a sound effect library that I can create through the Unity GUI and reference in any components that need it.
This makes it easier to try new sound effects because I only have to change one asset, instead of multiple instances across the project.
