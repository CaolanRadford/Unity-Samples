# Samples
Sample code from my latest project: 'Ratbag'.
This repo is intended to give an idea of how I currently like to program within Unity using C#.

The namespaces in these scripts do not match the architecture that is shown here. My projects include assets that are contributed by other people, and therefore I don't think it's fair to make their repositories public. 
As such, This repo is not intended to be representitive of any overall architecture set up, and instead, it is organised by pattern/functionality for ease of browsing, which might make the namespaces, corresponding to my project architecture (and not this repo's architecture) seem confusing.
